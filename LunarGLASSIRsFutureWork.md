## Discussions on LunarGLASS IR Metadata ##
LLVM 2.7 introduced extensible metadata in the LLVM IR, which can be leveraged in LunarGLASS to facilitate the preservation of information during the translation from the top IR to the bottom IR

The new feature is described on the LLVM Project blog [here](http://blog.llvm.org/2010/04/extensible-metadata-in-llvm-ir.html)
